project 1 - Chinook Database - Data Analysis Advanced nanodegree offered by FWD Egypt & Udacity.
here will be two parts to this project.

   + The first part is a series of questions that will assure you have mastered the main concepts taught throughout the SQL lessons. Though these questions will not graded" by a reviewer, they will help you self-assess.
  
    + The second part is a presentation. Similar to the first project, there isn't a 'right answer' for the second portion of the project.  then write a SQL query to pull the data needed to answer your question successfully. Use the pulled data to build a visual (bar chart, histogram, or another plot) that answers your question. The essentials of your project submission are discussed in the next sections.
